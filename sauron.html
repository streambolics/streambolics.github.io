# Home to sa.uron.be

This is my home page. Since I currently have nothing important to say, it might look a little bit ... er ... empty.

## How it works

My home page is hosted on GitHub Pages. I author it in MarkDown, which is converted on the fly to appropriate
HTML by a tool name StrapDown JS. By the way, that conversion script runs on your computer, and I am therefore
using a little bit of your computing power for my own purposes. And I'm not ashamed at all..

The DNS server is still at OVH, but it redirects here, since they don't want to host my pages anymore...

One of these days I will try to remember how to put links in Markdown documents so I can provide you with all the
useful information.
