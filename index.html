# Temporary homepage since OVH blew my subscription...

OVH chose to unilaterally close my subscription to an ASP.NET shared server, arguing
that this kind of sulution is "obsolete".

They want me to pay a higher price for a virtual server. However, since I do not
really use that much computing power, I'm now trying to move to a simpler solution.

Right now, you are reading a page hosted on GitHub.
