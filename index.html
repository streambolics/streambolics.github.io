# Temporary homepage since OVH blew my subscription...

OVH chose to unilaterally close my subscription to an ASP.NET shared server, arguing
that this kind of solution is "obsolete".

They want me to pay a higher price for a virtual server. However, since I do not
really use that much computing power, I'm now trying to move to a simpler solution.

Right now, you are reading a page hosted on GitHub.

# Are you using an Ad Blocker ????

Well, maybe. Or maybe not. To say the truth, this page does not even attempt to detect
whether you have one or not.

There are no ads embedded in this site, except maybe links to useful tools that I
use, such as GitHub, etc...
